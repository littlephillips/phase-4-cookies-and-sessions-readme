## Introduction

Cookies are small pieces of information that are sent from the server to the
client. They are then stored on the client (in the browser) and sent back to the
server with each subsequent request.

HTTP is a **stateless** protocol, since the server doesn't maintain information
about each client for all requests. Cookies help make **stateful** HTTP requests
by providing a mechanism for sending additional information to the server with
each request.

Cookies are _domain-specific_. The browser stores cookies for each domain (e.g.
`nytimes.com`) separately, and only cookies for that domain are sent back to
the server with subsequent requests.

Cookies are typically used to store session information (user login, shopping
cart, etc.), personalization (user preferences, themes, etc.) and tracking
information (analyzing user behavior). They provide a way for us to verify who
a user is once, and then remember it for their entire session. Without cookies,
you would have to provide your username and password on every single request to
the server.

In this document, we'll cover what cookies are, how they fit into the HTTP
request/response cycle, and how you can access them within your Rails
application.

## Page View Tracking

Let's say we want to build a paid blog site, like Medium. Users can view up to
5 articles per month for free, but after that, they need to subscribe to see
more content.

How can we keep track of a user's page views?

We could make a `User` model, and create a `pageviews_remaining` attribute to
keep track of how many articles the user can read; but ideally, we'd like to let
users browse the site without needing to log in, and still have some way of
tracking their page views.

When a user views an article, their browser will make a request to
`/articles/:id`.

Remember what's included in an HTTP request:

- An [HTTP verb][http methods rfc], like `GET`, `PUT`, or `POST`
- A path (`/articles/:id`)
- Various headers containing additional metadata (like the `Content-Type` of the
  request)

HTTP servers are typically stateless. They receive requests, process them,
return data, then forget about them. This means that all required information
must be passed with the request, either in the path or in the headers.

For example, `GET` requests usually encode the necessary information in the
path. When you write a route matching `/articles/:id`, you are telling Rails to
pull the value `id` from the request path and save it in `params[:id]`. In your
`articles_controller`, you'll probably have a method that looks something like:

```ruby
def show
  article = Article.find(params[:id])
  render json: article
end
```

This code loads the row for that article from the database and returns it as an
Active Record model object, which is then serialized as JSON. All the
information needed for the `GET` request — in this case, the `id` of the article
to render — is included in the path.

Similarly, if we want to be able to keep track of page views, we need to figure
out how to include that information in the request, either in the path or the
headers.

It would be possible, though quite convoluted, to store this information in the
path. Our JavaScript application could keep track of the articles the user has
viewed, and include the remaining page views as an additional query parameter in
the request: `/articles/3?pageviews_remaining=5`. However, there are a few flaws
to this approach: most obviously, it would be incredibly simple for the user to
change this number in the request and circumvent our paywall:
`/articles/3?pageviews_remaining=999`.

Luckily, cookies allow us to store this information in the only other place
available to us: HTTP headers.

## What's a Cookie, Anyway?

Let's see what [the spec][rfc_cookies] has to say:

```txt
This section outlines a way for an origin server to send state
information to a user agent and for the user agent to return the
state information to the origin server.

To store state, the origin server includes a Set-Cookie header in an
HTTP response.  In subsequent requests, the user agent returns a
Cookie request header to the origin server.  The Cookie header
contains cookies the user agent received in previous Set-Cookie
headers.  The origin server is free to ignore the Cookie header or
use its contents for an application-defined purpose.
```

The description is quite technical, so let's look at their example:

```txt
== Server -> User Agent ==
Set-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42

== User Agent -> Server ==
Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42
```

In this example, the server is an HTTP server, and the User Agent is a browser.
The server responds to a request with the `Set-Cookie` header. This header sets
the value of the `SID` cookie to `31d4d96e407aad42`.

Next, when the user visits another page on the same server, the browser sends
the cookie back to the server, including the `Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42`
header in its request.

Cookies are stored in the browser. The browser doesn't care about what's in the
cookies you set. It just stores the data and sends it along on future requests
to your server. You can think of them as a hash — and indeed, as we'll see
later, Rails exposes cookies with a method that behaves much like a hash.

## Using Cookies

So how would we use a cookie to store a reference to the user's page views?
Let's say that we create a page view counter the first time a user views an
article. Then, in the **response**, we might include the header:

```txt
== Server -> User Agent ==
Set-Cookie: pageviews_remaining=5
```

When the user views another article, we can instruct the browser to include
the cookie in the **request** headers:

```txt
== User Agent -> Server ==
Cookie: pageviews_remaining=5
```

We can look at this HTTP header, get the `pageviews_remaining` from it, and
write some conditional logic to customize the response based on the
`pageviews_remaining` to either return the article, or return a message
indicating that our frontend should show the paywall.

## Security Concerns

Cookies are stored as plain text in a user's browser. Therefore, the user can
see what's in them, and they can set them to anything they want.

If you open the developer console in your browser, you can see the cookies set
by the current site. In Chrome's console, you can find this under
`Application > Cookies`. You can delete any cookie you like. For example, if you
delete your `user_session` cookie on `github.com` and refresh the page, you will
find that you've been logged out.

You can also edit cookies, for example with [this extension][edit_this_cookie].

This presents a problem for us. If users can edit their `pageviews_remaining`
cookie, then they can easily give themselves an unlimited amount of page views.

## Rails to the Rescue

Fortunately, Rails has a solution to this. Instead of sending our cookies in
plain text, we can use Rails to **encrypt** and **sign** a special cookie known
as a session using the `session` method. The `session` method is available
in your controller, and it behaves like a hash:

```ruby
  session[:pageviews_remaining] = 5
```

You can store any simple Ruby object in the session.

By default, Rails manages all session data in a single cookie. It _serializes_
all the key/value pairs you set with `session`, converting them from a Ruby
object into a big string. Whenever you set a `key` with the `session` method,
Rails updates the value of its session cookie to this big string.

When you set cookies this way, Rails **signs** them to prevent users from
tampering with them. Your Rails server has a key, configured in
`config/credentials.yml.enc`.

```txt
development:
  secret_key_base: kaleisgreat  # probably not the most secure key ever
```

Somewhere else, Rails has a method, let's call it `sign`, which takes a
`message` and a `key` and returns a `signature`, which is just a string:

```ruby
# sign(message: string, key: string) -> signature: string
def sign(message, key):
  # cryptographic magic here
  return signature
end
```

It's guaranteed that given the same message and key, `sign` will produce the
same output. Also, without the key, it is practically impossible to know what
`sign` would return for a given message. That is, signatures can't be forged.

Rails creates a signature for every session cookie it sets, and appends the
signature to the cookie.

When it receives a cookie, Rails verifies that the signature matches the content
(that is, that `sign(cookie_body, secret_key_base) == cookie_signature`).

This prevents cookie tampering. If a user tries to edit their cookie and change
the `pageviews_remaining`, the signature won't match, and Rails will silently
ignore the cookie and set a new one.

Cryptography is a deep rabbit hole. At this point, you don't need to understand
the specifics of how cryptography works, just that Rails and other frameworks
use it to ensure that session data which is set on the server can't be edited by
users.

## Conclusion

Cookies are foundational for the modern web.

Most sites use cookies, to let their users log in, keep track of their shopping
carts, or record other ephemeral session data. Almost nobody thinks these are
bad uses of cookies: nobody really believes that you should have to type in your
username and password on every page, or that your shopping cart should clear if
you reload the page.

But cookies let you store data in a user's browser, so by nature, they can be
used for more controversial endeavors.

For example, Google AdWords sets a cookie and uses that cookie to track what ads
you've seen and which ones you've clicked on. The tracking information helps
AdWords decide what ads to show you.

This is why, if you click on an ad, you may find that the ad follows you around
the internet. It turns out that this behavior is as effective as it is annoying:
people are far more likely to buy things from ads that they've clicked on once.

This use of cookies worries people and the EU
[has created legislation around the use of cookies][eu_law].

Cookies, like any technology, are a tool. In the rest of this module, we're going
to be using them to let users log in. Whether you later want to use them in such
a way that the EU passes another law is up to you.

## Check For Understanding

Before you move on, make sure you can answer the following questions:

1. What do we mean when we say that HTTP is stateless?
2. What Rails method can you use to protect cookies from being tampered with by
   users? What two things does Rails do to secure the cookie?
